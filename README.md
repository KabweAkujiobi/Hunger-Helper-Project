The Hunger Hepler Project:

This is a web-based system that is dedicated to reducing food waste by connecting local supermarkets, restaurants and other food supliers with NGOs. 
This system allows NGOs to locate excess food in their area quickly, ensuring that surplus food reaches those who need it most.

Features:
Real-time Food Availability: NGOs can view and claim available excess food in real-time from participating restaurants and supermarkets.
Geolocation Integration: The platform uses geolocation to show NGOs nearby food sources, making it easier to collect and distribute food efficiently.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity in mind, the system offers an intuitive interface for both food suppliers and NGOs.
Automated Notifications: NGOs receive notifications when new food donations are available in their vicinity.

Before using the Hunger Helper System, ensure you have:
A PC with internet access.
An account created on the Zero Hunger platform (either as a food supplier or an NGO).
